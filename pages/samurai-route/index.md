In January 2010 I had a crazy idea: to **travel by motorbike from Spain to Japan** in 3 months (around 20.000Km) and then spend 2 months traveling around Japan. We called it "La Ruta del samurai" (The Samurai Route).

I've been riding motorcycles since I was 17 but never really traveled long distances with one of them, not even 500 Km! I also wanted to explore my limits, get away from the computer for some time, feel more in contact with nature and of course, visit Japan!

I passed the exam for the "big motorcycles" license and bought a [Yamaha XT660Z Teneré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_XT660Z_T%C3%A9n%C3%A9r%C3%A9). It wasn't my favorite model, but in the end, it turned out to be a great choice for that kind of trip. I [spent a few months preparing for the trip](/blog/category/samurai-route) and found some kind sponsors and a partner. Finally, in June, I left my hometown and started this great adventure :-) [View pictures](https://www.facebook.com/rutasamurai/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums)
