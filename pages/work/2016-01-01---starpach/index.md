This is my interpretation of the classic asteroids game, which I called `starpach`. It uses [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) as the game engine. The asteroids and the soundtrack were made by the artist (and friend) Josep Manen.

The game was featured on the homepage of this website (joanmira.com) until January 2019.
