Fluzo capacitors, starfighters, galaxy wars, stories of replicants, aliens, adventurous archaeologists, bratty monsters, aliens, robocops... during the 80s, a multitude of wonderful movies emerged that have marked a whole generation of children who are now adults and remember with great affection those stories full of creativity and adventures.

I have assembled a _ranking_ of the best movies of the 80s, **ordered from lowest to highest score**, according to an average score obtained from the databases of [imdb](http://www.imdb.com/) and [rotten tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/). This list may be a bit influenced by the sci-fi genre and I've probably forgotten some important movies (hopefully not many!), but I hope you like them ;-)

14th century. It all begins one fine late November morning in the year of our Lord 1327 when Friar William of Baskerville (Sean Connery), a Franciscan monk and former inquisitor, and his inseparable disciple the novice Adso de Melk (Christian Slater), who narrates the story, go to a Benedictine abbey located in the north of the Italian peninsula to try to shed light on the death of the young miniaturist Adelmo da Otranto. During their stay at the abbey, more monks mysteriously disappear and are soon found dead. Slowly, and thanks to the information provided by some of the monks, Guillermo begins to clarify the facts. The motive for the crimes seems to be some ancient treatises on the lawfulness of laughter found in the library of the complex, which is said to be the largest in the Christian world. Who is the murderer? What did his victims do to be killed? No one knows...

In the early 21st century, the powerful Tyrell Corporation developed a new type of robot called Nexus, a being virtually identical to man and known as a Replicant. Nexus-6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence, to the genetic engineers who created them. In outer space, Replicants were used as slave laborers in the risky exploration and colonization of other planets. After the bloody rebellion of a Nexus-6 combat team on a sidereal colony, the Replicants have declared outlaws on Earth under penalty of death. Brigades of special police, under the name of Blade Runner Units, were ordered to shoot to kill at the sight of any invading Replicator. This was not called an execution, it was called a retreat.
