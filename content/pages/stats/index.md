###Page speed

![](./images/page-speed-report.jpg)
Report provided by [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/). There are still a few improvements that can be done around images and Nginx tuning.

###Easter eggs

There are a few hidden surprises in the website.

**Clue**: if you think the contact or about pages are looking quite plain, maybe you could try to spice them up with a famous (コナミコマンド) code ... On the other hand, if you are not very lucky playing Starpach, you could get some help by typing 'cheater' :P

My maximum score at Starpach (without cheating) is 5610 points at level 17.
