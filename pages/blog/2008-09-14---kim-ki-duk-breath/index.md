This entry is dedicated with special illusion to all those who are not yet familiar with Asian cinema and especially Korean cinema, which has several directors who are making pretty good movies. Among them is "[Kim-ki-duk](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ki-duk)", one of my favorites, for his ability to tell stories without the need for the actors to say practically nothing throughout the film (which is quite useful to see them in the original version) and in this way it is easy to notice much more in the body language, in the composition of the scenes and in general gives the viewer more freedom to think while watching the film.

Last night I saw one of his latest films "[Breath](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rW7AlCH1L4)" from 2007 and I can only recommend it to you. It is a sad story but with a deep message of hope and empathy.
