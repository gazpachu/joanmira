I built the Standup app as an experiment to make remote scrum standup sessions more fun!

The app uses a technology called WebRTC to reproduce a videoconference interface similar to Google Hangouts. The front-end uses a wrapper called [SimpleWebRTC](https://github.com/andyet/SimpleWebRTC). In the back-end, a service provider called [Xirsys](https://xirsys.com/), and a signalling server called [SignalMaster](https://github.com/andyet/signalmaster) help to overcome common network hickups like NATs, Firewalls and VPNs.

The app is currently under development and the TURN servers might not work anymore, so it's not production ready! Although you can try to chat with one or two other users...
