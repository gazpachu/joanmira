    <h2>The studio</h2>
    <p>I started producing commercial creative works for my clients in year 2000. Later in 2006, I officially <b>co-founded Webmarket S.C.</b>, a small interactive design agency. It was active until 2012. I spent the next 10 years in <b>London and Tokyo</b>, working for great companies and learning from very talented colleagues. In 2022, I reopened the studio, this time under my personal brand and offering services in cutting-edge software engineering, UI UX design and interactive art installations.</p>
    <p>My initial mission with the studio going forward is to <b>contribute to the open-source world</b>, <b>help startups</b> (especially in Alicante), <b>build a SaaS product</b> and start producing <b>interactive art installations</b>.</p>
    <p>The <b>studio is located in Alicante</b>, although my clients and collaborators are from different parts of the world.</p>
