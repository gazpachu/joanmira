While working at WCRS, I was asked to build an animated responsive HTML Artemis ad for the iPad. This ad was displayed in the Times and Sunday websites. I used the libraries [spritely](http://spritely.net/) and [transit](http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/) to create the sequence of animated sprites and the CSS3 animations.

I was also involved in several content updates for the Artemis website and newsletter.
