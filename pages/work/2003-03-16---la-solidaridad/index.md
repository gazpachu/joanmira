La Solidaridad was a personal project (together with my wife). Its purpose was to be an online newspaper to talk about ecology, immigration, politics, economy, etc.

It was also like an online playground where I could explore and practice with graphic elements, and animations within a CMS like PHP-Nuke.

After some time, the website was migrated to Joomla and the theme became more impersonal, which eventually ended up killing the project.
