AndCounting is a collabaration with the entrepreneur and designer Cristina Gaston. The idea was to build an Android app to track multiple projects using stop-watches. The prototype was built using the Cordova platform and allowed the user to start/stop projects, rename them and add new ones to the interface. The report button would send an email with the time logged on each project.
