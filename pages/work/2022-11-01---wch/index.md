Around September 2022, [Anthony Wilkinson](https://wimbledonmusicfestival.co.uk/founder-festival-director/) (an award-winner British theatre and film director) contacted me to see if I was interested to build a website for the new Wimbledon Concert Hall designed by [Frank Gehry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry). The purpose of the website was to showcase the project's details to inform potential donors. He found my [case study of the Royal Opera House](/work/roh) and thought that I would be the perfect person to take on the project. I didn't hesitate to accept it.

The website was built using the [minimalistic custom static site generator](/blog/why-i-left-gatsby-and-built-my-own-tiny-static-site-generator) that I build a few months ago. Then the generated files were deployed automatically to Netlify. A simple static website without the need to have a CMS or any server-side logic.

The website is fully responsive and supports dark mode. It also has a custom full-screen image viewer, transcripts for all the videos (for SEO purposes) and a simple blog section.
