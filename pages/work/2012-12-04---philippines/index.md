While directing Webmarket.es, I partnered with the Philippines government to build a few websites for their embassies and investment centers:

* Philippine embassy in London (WordPress)
* Trade and investment center in the USA (WordPress)
* Trade and investment center in the UK (Joomla)
* Philippine embassy in Brussels (Joomla)

The oldest websites were built with Joomla (only desktop view) while the new ones were built with WordPress and were fully responsive. In both cases, I used a custom template and graphic design.
