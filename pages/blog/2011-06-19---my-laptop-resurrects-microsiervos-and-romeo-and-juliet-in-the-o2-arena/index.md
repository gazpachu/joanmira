This week has been very good. The first good news was on Tuesday when I received the ATI x1400 I had purchased on eBay. I installed it on my late DELL Inspiron 9400, said an Our Father and booted up... I almost had a tear in my eye. The second piece of good news came the next day when I finally managed to finish the article on the 1001 movies to watch before you die. But that's not the end of the story. I sent it to Alvy from Microsiervos and within half an hour he had already [published it on the web](http://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/peliculas-tv/1001-peliculas-ver.html). What a rush!!!, both emotionally and in terms of visits. In fact, in the first hours after it was published, my server was saturated by the traffic and the web was down. During this week, I have experienced a 400% increase in traffic, with more than 20,000 unique users O_O

To top off the week, on Thursday I went to see Romeo and Juliet at the O2 Arena with Farah, her husband, Tintin, Barbar√° and Tuesday. It was amazing, especially Tamara Rojo - what a cracker, 37 years old and she moves like she's 20. Also, I was very surprised by the creativity in the choreography, with scenes like when Carlos Acosta lifts Julieta (already dead). You can tell they are the best dancers in the world.
