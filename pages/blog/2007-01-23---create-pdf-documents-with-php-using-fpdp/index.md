I have found a very useful tool for web programmers that more than one may be interested in. It's called FPDF and it's free! Here is a list of its main features:

- Choice of the unit of measurement, page formatting and margins.
- Header and footer management
- Automatic page break
- Automatic line break and text justification
- Image support (JPEG and PNG)
- Colors
- Linking
- TrueType, Type1 fonts and encoding support
- Page compression

The [tutorials](http://www.fpdf.org/es/tutorial/index.php) will get you started quickly with FPDF. The complete online documentation can be found [here](http://www.fpdf.org/es/doc/index.php) and the download area [here](http://www.fpdf.org/es/download.php).
