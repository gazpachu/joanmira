Wekohi is a web app to find remote-friendly caf√©s around the world. Although the prototype only displays places in Tokyo, it is ready to work with any place around the world.

I envisioned this project for the second hackathon event in TableCheck and we won the first prize! It was fun and we worked very hard for a couple of days to bring it to life! The team included other TableCheck employees: Eri Koyano (PM), Alexander Bykanov (Back-end), Martin Yates (Design) and Alexandr Shostyr (Front-end).

I worked on the front-end side together with Alexandr.
