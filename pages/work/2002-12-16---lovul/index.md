L'Ã’vul was a cultural magazine I got involved with. It was made with love by friends in Barcelona. I built this microsite to display the latest issues of the magazine, info and dates of upcoming events and a few artworks.

Most of the content is now offline, but you can have a look at the quirky animations ;-)
