#### Digital developer
<span class="project-tag red-tag">Feb 2011 - Sep 2012</span><a class="project-tag gold-tag" href="http://www.roh.org.uk">Royal Opera House</a><span class="project-tag blue-tag">Covent Garden, London (UK)</span>

Was honored to be the first hired developer in the history of the Royal Opera House. Joined the newly created development team under the digital media department with a very important objective: to completely rebuild the [ROH website](http://www.roh.org.uk/) from scratch. A business-critical project that required a major overhaul in the ticketing system, server infrastructure, information architecture, user experience, content management and an online shop to match the high standards of the organization.

The development team was small; two full-stack developers, one design manager and a CTO. This scenario allowed me to have considerable influence on the application architecture and the overall development of the website.

As a result, the [online ticket sales increased to 60%](/blog/the-royal-opera-house-in-numbers) - no more waiting rooms - and all the digital content and user experience improved thanks to the robust framework and work methodology established by the digital media team.

I also developed an app to display the schedule of [the Royal [Ballet](http://www.roh.org.uk/about/the-royal-ballet) rehearsals on TV screens

We tend to forget that creativity takes on many forms and in this case, Joan has rightfully reminded me so. Joan has been an absolute joy to work with. Where an animation or difficult task is presented, the usual response from developers would be a quizzical look and a shake of the head. Joan has been nothing but enthusiastic to tackle animations and other challenges full-on, constantly coming up with better, improved solutions to the code and researching and suggests his ground-breaking ideas on animations and possible renditions to the creative work. On top of this, he has stepped in as a wonderful and reliable leader within the team and displayed commendable organizational and management skills. Finding a developer that can code exceptionally is very, very difficult, but finding one that also has wonderful people and leadership skills that greets problems with smiles is practically impossible - I'm so glad we've got Joan in the company.
