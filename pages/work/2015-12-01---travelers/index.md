While working at SapientNitro, I got involved in the Travelers account. I helped with the front-end development of the new responsive insurance quote journey.

Due to the nature of the business (it handles sensitive data), we were asked to work using vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks), which meant we had to build many reusable and flexible components from scratch.

The journey is a chain of complex forms, which are navigated using a timeline and next/previous buttons. Some parts of the business logic were tricky, which turned out to be challenging to solve from a UX point of view, but after many tests, we got it right, which means more success for our client and a better experience for his customers.
