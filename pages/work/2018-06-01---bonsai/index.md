Bonsai is a hierarchy management tool to search, view and adjust employee data coming from Active Directory.

I owned the 100% of the front-end work in this project. Initially, I designed a clickable prototype with Adobe XD to test the user journeys with my team. Then I built a prototype with the usual React boilerplate and a custom design. Later on, the app received more features and eventually, a new design that I also implemented.
