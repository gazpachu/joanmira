I built Momardi.com initially with a custom template for Wordpress, but after a couple of years, we moved it into the Ghost platform and built another custom theme. And then, after a few more years, I moved to a GatsbyJS platform.

Momardi is the personal website of Tuesday Gutierrez. It showcases art exhibits in galleries / museums and also features articles about new artists.
