The Awards for design, creativity and innovation on the internet, aka [AWWWARDS](http://www.awwwards.com), have published the [list of nominated projects for 2015](http://www.awwwards.com/annual-awards-2015/). These awards, together with [theFWA](http://www.thefwa.com/), are the maximum awards given in the Internet. You can call them the Oscars and Grammys of the Internet.

Anyway, **I have a favourite** and you probably have seen it before. It's called [Species in Pieces](http://species-in-pieces.com/). A beautiful CSS-based interactive exhibition by [Bryan James](http://www.bryanjamesdesign.co.uk/).

It's a remarkable project with a technical difficulty beyond what normal people can imagine, as all the animals have been **hand crafted manually and purely with CSS**. I can see this type of work being recognised in future generations as an example of creative innovation.

Best of luck with that award!
