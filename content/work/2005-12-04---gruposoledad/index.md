Grupo Soledad asked me to create a visually attractive website for the French market. They wanted to showcase their catalog of car tyres and batteries and be able to update the offers of the website using a simple CMS.

Grupo Soledad also asked me to build a multi-lingual animated Flash intro with navigation to use as a gateway to other websites from the group.
