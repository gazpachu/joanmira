During my tenure at [WCRS](http://www.wcrs.com), I worked on the Radettes Facebook App for [Radox](http://www.radox.co.uk/).

"The Radettes" is a musical trio of puppets who sing users' status updates.

Songs they perform include a blues track for people to let friends know they have lost their phone, a new-romantic number for those who want to gloat about being on holiday and a pop track for people who want to tell friends they like their post.
