Well, it was about time to change the green apple logo, which although I liked it a lot, was a semi-copy of the Apple logo. So now we are a little bit more different and with more personality.

The logo represents an M and a W, which are the initials of Web Market... as you can see, a display of creativity (tap on the back). If anyone would like to give their opinion, as long as it's constructive, please go ahead.
