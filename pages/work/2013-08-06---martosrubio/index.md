The spanish artist, Milagros Martos Rubio, asked me to build a website to showcase her work:

3rd version: Based on CRA (React) with simple JSON files to organize the artworks and categories

2nd version: Based on Ghost with a custom responsive theme.

1st version: Based on Wordpress with a custom theme with horizontal scrolling (mocking the wall of an art gallery).
