During the last six days, we have been sending letters to companies and institutions that we think might be interested in participating in this project. In total, we have sent more than twenty, to companies such as Rukka, TCX, IXS, Decathlon, Altus, Arai, GoPro, Canon, Panasonic, Sony, Hepco & Becker, La Caixa, Metzeler, Ã–hlins, Starcom1, The North Face, Oxford, Touratech, Ubricar Motos, Wunderlich and Yamaha. We have also sent it to the city council of Coria del Rio.

We have done it in the best possible way:

- with a personalized proposal for each sponsor
- printing the envelopes
- enclosing a magnet of the Samurai Route
- enclosing a Samurai Route business card.

We have not sent a T-shirt because they are not ready yet, but if you agree to collaborate with us, we will send it to you for sure!
