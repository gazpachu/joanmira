Like other creative people, I get inspiration from many different sources: art, music, cinema, science, computers, technology, etc. My work and artistic expression is an elaborate interpretation of these things - sometimes it can be a slight modification or a pure integration into another module or piece. Other times it can be the canvas from where I start to create. In any case, I am grateful to credit the authors and share their valuable work with everyone.
