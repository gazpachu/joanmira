In January 2010 I had a crazy idea: to **travel by motorbike from Spain to Japan** in 3 months (around 20.000Km) and then spend 2 months travelling around Japan. I've been riding motorcycles since I was 17 but never really travelled long distances with one of them, not even 500 Km!. I also wanted to explore my limits, get away from the computer for some time, feel more in contact with nature and of course, visit Japan!

I passed the exam for the "big motorcycles" license and bought a [Yamaha XT660Z Teneré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_XT660Z_T%C3%A9n%C3%A9r%C3%A9). It wasn't my favourite model, but at the end, it turned out to be a great choice for that kind of trip. I [spent a few months preparing the trip](/category/samurai-route), found some kind sponsors and a partner. Finally, on June, I left my hometown and started this great adventure :-) [ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rutasamurai/photos_stream?tab=photos_albums" target="_blank">view pictures</a> ]
