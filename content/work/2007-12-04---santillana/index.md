As part of my business relationship with Narcea Multimedia, I built several interactive CDs for [Santillana](http://www.santillana.es/), a well known book publisher specialised in educational materials.

This project was big, with many different interactive pieces, animations, games, narrations, scorm integration and other accessibility aids.

The range of created apps go from the human body, hygiene, alimentation to games, prevention of accidents, hydrotherapy, music-therapy, animals and plants, etc.
