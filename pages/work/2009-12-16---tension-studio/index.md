I met Josep Manen in 2002 and since then, we have partnered in many cultural and artistic projects. He's a very talented musician, specialiasing in sound engineering for multimedia productions and his website features his services and the projects he has created.

Josep asked me to build a Wordpress website for his company: Tension Studio. A few months later, we created a new template with an e-commerce module.
