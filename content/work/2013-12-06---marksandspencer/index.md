While working at SapientNitro, I was asked to get involved in the Marks & Spencer project (iPad version) to develop and user test a vertical navigation, work in the main navigation, fix bugs and test the performance of different approaches across the pages of the site, including the home page, PLP, PDP, landing pages, etc.

Tech stack included: CSS3, Pub/Sub, Mustache, jQuery, Vanilla Javascript, Modernizr, HTML5, Charles Proxy, etc.

SapientNitro has lead M&S through quite literally the biggest multi-channel retail re-platform in history with more than 600 SapientNitro people on the project that have worked more than 1.1 million hours!
