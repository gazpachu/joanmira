While I was working at Slater Labs as a software engineer, I took the creation of the company website as a side project. I wanted to explore new things, like the use of animated 3d models, playing with the webcam and the microphone and voice recognition. In a way, I wanted to mimic a little bit the kind of interactive behaviours that we were building for the desktop applications of the company.

There is also a template for Slater Labs USA, but this wasn't completed, so it's more like a quick mockup. The color of the sky changes based on the time.
