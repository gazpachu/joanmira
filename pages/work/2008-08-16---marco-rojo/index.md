This project is a collaboration with the agency Narcea Multimedia. El Marco Rojo (a photography studio specializing in weddings) was their client. I joined the team and took full responsibility for the development and creation of the sites. They required a Flash site to showcase their photo galleries, a custom Flash CMS to upload new content and a Wordpress-powered blog.
