Commit is a sales forecasting capture tool that replaces manual forecasting processes. It gathers and displays committed opportunities in one place.

In this project, I was in charge of restyling most parts of the front end and I helped another co-worker to build the rest of it.

From a UI perspective, Commit is quite a straightforward app. Perhaps, one of the most interesting aspects would be the animated SVG radial charts that I had to build for the summary section in the header. The rest of the UI is just composed of a tabs component with a table on each tab, a top nav with several drop-downs and some colorful boxes. The app is also fully responsive.
