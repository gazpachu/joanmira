It's been more than a year since I wrote anything on the blog and now I know why... it's the damn Facebook. It had me hooked, but that's over now. I have deactivated my account and I hope not to open it again for a long time!

Well, today I'd like to tell you about this movie that I just saw and that has filled me with inspiration and joy. It's about "Searching for Sugar Man", the story of Sixto Rodriguez, a folk singer from Detroit who released an album in the 70s but was not successful in the US. I'm not going to tell anything else because, unlike my wife, I prefer to watch a movie knowing practically nothing beforehand.Â You have to see it!

I liked it so much that when I finished watching it I went directly to Amazon to buy [the DVD of the movie](http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B008C1WUZ2/ref=s9_simh_gw_p15_d0_i1?pf_rd_m=A1AT7YVPFBWXBL&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=1XC147RMDBQCJXP3GYDV&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=312235527&pf_rd_i=602357031) and [the CD of their first album](http://www.amazon.es/Cold-Fact-Rodriguez/dp/B001BKVWYG/ref=pd_sim_m_3) for my father (a great lover of American Folk music).

Rodriguez! you already have one more fan!
