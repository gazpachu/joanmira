Since I was very young, I liked computers and techy stuff; this hobby started at the age of 7 when I visited my cousins from Barcelona. I was amazed by the things the [Amiga 500](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) could do and more than anything, I was very jealous of the nearly 1000 videogames that my cousin was able to download from [BBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system) and other *underground* channels...

During those times, a [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) and an [Atari 2600](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600) arrived at my home with a cartridge containing 32 games (if I remember well). What a wonderful time... I was constantly visiting neighbors to play [Super Sprint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Sprint) in [Spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_ZX_Spectrum), or the [Monkey Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island) (in black &amp; white) in the PC 286 of the guy on the 5th floor, or playing [Ghost’n'Goblins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_%27n_Goblins) in the [Amstrad 664](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_664) with  3” floppies! of my schoolmate. At that time, we were patient with the loading times. We just wanted to play games like [Double Dragon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dragon_%28arcade_game%29) on a green screen, even if we had to wait 15 minutes listening to psychophonies from the Amstrad 464 while loading the game from the cassette.

I believe that the beginning of my [geek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek) life started exactly the day of my first communion (in March 1989), when my wise grandmother decided to buy the [Amstrad 464](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_464) with 400 cassette games from my cousin to give to me. During those years, I was also playing with the famous [Amstrad PC 1512](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_1512) from my family in Almería. A really good computer that used 5 1/4'' disks. A few years later, my father bought an [Amstrad PCW 8256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PCW#PCW_8256_and_8512) with a printer and green screen. I wasn't very convinced because there were very few games available on that computer.

I remember with special love the "Focus" game saloon in Playa San Juan (Alicante), where the 100 pesetas and 25 pesetas coins were wisely changed in favor of the trick with the electric lighter. We used them to generate a spark inside the coins gap to obtain free credits in the arcade machines. I remember authentic classics like the [Wonder Boy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Boy_%28Arcade%29), [Side Arms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_Arms), [Gun Smoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun.Smoke), [Legendary Wings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendary_Wings), the famous [Street Fighter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_%28series%29), [Hard Driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Drivin%27), [Hammerin’ Harry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerin%27_Harry), [Vigilante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilante_(video_game)), [Kung-Fu Master](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_%28video_game%29), [Road Fighter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Fighter), [Spy Hunter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_Hunter), [Track and Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_%26_Field_(video_game)), [Green Beret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush%27n_Attack), [Contra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_%28arcade_game%29), [Combat School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_School), [Lethal Enforcers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_Enforcers), [Mortal Kombat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_%28video_game%29), [Gaunlet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_%28arcade_game%29), [Enduro Racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enduro_Racer), [Super Hang-on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Hang-On), [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris), [Out Run](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_Run), [Altered Beast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Beast), [Golden Axe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Axe), [Heavy Weight Champ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight_Champ), [Passing shot](https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8986), [After Burner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Burner), [Fatal Fury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Fury), [Metal Slug](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Slug), [Super Sidekicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Sidekicks_(video_game)), [Windjammers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windjammers_(video_game)), [Bubble Bobble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Bobble), [Operation Wolf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wolf), [Rastan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastan_Saga), [Wardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardner_(video_game)), [Chase HQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_HQ), [Cabal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal_%28arcade_game%29), [Snow Bros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Bros),... really good times of videogame obsession.

The SEGA [Megadrive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Mega_Drive) with [Sonic: the HedgeHog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28Mega_Drive%29) turned me into a proper addict. I recall it cost me around 27.000 pesetas and due to my low income, I wasn't able to buy a [Super Nintendo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System). That's the reason I never played [Zelda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda) and other great [Nintendo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo) games when I was a kid.

However, even if I was very into games, I never stopped studying, although [Dragon Ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball), [Big Red Racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Red_Racing) and the [Playstation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation) were constant distractions.

### Did you know that...

* The first RAM module I bought (slot SIMM) was just for 4 MB and cost me 20.000 pesetas! I got it in the summer of 1994 via [CentroMAIL](http://www.centromail.es) (from PCMANIA) and used it to play [Bioforge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioforge) in my 486 SX 33Mhz with CDROM!

* The neighborhood where I grew up was full of kids addicted to video games. We were constantly exchanging games like the [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), [Rise of the Robots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Robots) or the wonderful [The Dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dig_(video_game)) (one of my favorite graphic adventures ever).

* Near my home, there was a bar (just crossing the street) and as far as I remember, there was always an arcade machine. I could tell many stories about that place. It was so popular that the fights were constant. Some of the videogames from that place were: [Captain Commando](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Commando), [Final Fight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fight), [Three Wonders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Wonders), [Shinobi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinobi_series) and [Pang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Bros).

* During my childhood, I only saw one time someone finishing [Ghost’n'Goblins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts'n_Goblins) in the arcade. It's very very difficult!

* In the bar near my elementary school, they had [the arcade with the chicken game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Story)... I was rubbish on that game.

Thanks for reading all this! :-)
