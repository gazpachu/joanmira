<a href="http://wekohi.com">Wekohi</a> is a web app to find remote-friendly caf√©s around the world. Although the prototype only displays places in Tokyo, it does work (while the domain and google API are still up). So, if you live in Tokyo, check it out!

I envisioned this project for the second hackathon event in TableCheck and we won the first price! It was fun and we worked very hard for a couple of days to bring it to life! The team included other TableCheck employees: Eri Koyano (PM), Alexander Bykanov (Back-end), Martin Yates (Design) and Alexandr Shostyr (Front-end).
