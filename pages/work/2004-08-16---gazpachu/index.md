GAZ New Media Design (aka gazpachu.com) was my first identity as a freelance web designer. It was created as a very naive and unpretentious brand. My target was to learn as I go with the process of building websites. After a few years, I decided to get rid of it (in a professional level) and convert it into a personal blog (v5), which after a few years I also decided to kill it in favour of joanmira.com.

The showcase of the following websites is just for fun, please don't take them too seriously...
