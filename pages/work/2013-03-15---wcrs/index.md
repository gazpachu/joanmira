During my tenure at WCRS, I was involved in several brainstorms, promotional ideas, internal projects, hack evenings, small micro sites and games. Some of them include:

* Creative work to promote on mobile phones the new electric [BMW](https://www.bmw.co.uk)'s i3
* Creative work for [Bupa](https://www.bupa.com/)'s health services
* Brainstorming and conceptualization of ideas for a [Royal Navy](https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/) project
* A Google Maps hack to retrieve directions from point A to B
* A WordPress plugin adaptation to capture the details of candidates for the WCRS work experience program
* An internal newsletter template regarding Social Media
* What should they call it? A small microsite to find out the best name for the new royal baby
