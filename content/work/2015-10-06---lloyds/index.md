As part of SapientNitro's pitching activities with Lloyds Bank, I was asked to build a microsite to encapsulate all the information, documents, videos and event logs.

From a dev perspective, the project was quite simple, but we had to be sure the website was secure and IE7 compatible, which always complicates things a little bit.

The website was based on a responsive HTML5 template called [Canvas](http://themes.semicolonweb.com/html/canvas/intro.php), which we used to quickly layout the different sections.

After a few days, we decided to adapt the static website and transform it into a Wordpress theme to allow a more developer-independent content update.

SapientNitro finally won the pitch ;-)
