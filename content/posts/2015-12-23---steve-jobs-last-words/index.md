<p>There is a claim that Apple co-founder Steve Jobs left behind a deathbed essay about how the <em>“non-stop pursuit of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being, just like me.” </em>To many entrepreneurs, he is a legend and the epitome of success, having created the most valuable company in the world, and leaving a legacy that left millions, if not billions, tearful.</p>
<p>In November 2015, a rumor began circulating on social media that when Apple co-founder Steve Jobs passed away at age 56 in 2011, he delivered a speech or left behind a deathbed essay about the meaning of life. Whether true or not, it has a profound impact on the way we should all look at life.</p>
<p><em>I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others’ eyes, my life is an epitome of success.</em></p>
<p><em>However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to.</em></p>
<div>
<p><em>At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realise that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death.</em></p>
<p><em>In the darkness, I look at the green lights from the life supporting machines and hear the humming mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of god of death drawing closer…</em></p>
<p><em>Now I know, when we have accumulated sufficient wealth to last our lifetime, we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth…</em></p>
<p><em>Should be something that is more important:</em><br>
<em>Perhaps relationships, perhaps art, perhaps a dream from younger days.</em></p>
<p><em>Non-stop pursuing of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being, just like me.</em></p>
<p><em>God gave us the senses to let us feel the love in everyone’s heart, not the illusions brought about by wealth.</em></p>
<p><em>The wealth I have won in my life I cannot bring with me. What I can bring is only the memories precipitated by love.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s the true riches which will follow you, accompany you, giving you strength and light to go on.</em></p>
<p><em>Love can travel a thousand miles. Life has no limit. Go where you want to go. Reach the height you want to reach. It is all in your heart and in your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the most expensive bed in the world? Sick bed…<br>
</em><br>
<em>You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you.</em></p>
<p><em>Material things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost – Life.</em></p>
<p><em>When a person goes into the operating room, he will realise that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading – Book of Healthy Life.</em></p>
<p><em>Whichever stage in life we are at right now, with time, we will face the day when the curtain comes down.</em></p>
<p><em>Treasure Love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends.</em></p>
<p><em>Treat yourself well. Cherish others.</em></p>
