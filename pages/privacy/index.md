Privacy matters but it can be confusing. This page explains the studio approach to privacy and how it affects you.

### Short version

* Statistics are collected about your visit, like which pages you viewed
* Statistics are not shared with anyone else

These are just the key points. If you need detail, keep reading.

### Measuring the visitors

Visitors to the website are measured using [Posthog](https://posthog.com/). It records what pages you view within joanmira.com, how you arrived at the site and some basic information about your computer.

The information collected from Posthog helps to understand what parts of the site are doing well, how people arrive at the site and so on. Like most websites, this information is used to make the website better.

### Discussion comments

To allow visitors to discuss the blog articles and some web pages, a discussion system based on Github issues called [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) is used.

The Utterances widget code is out of the control of joanmira.com. Nonetheless, on their website they say: No tracking, no ads, always free.

To be able to comment, you need to register an account on [Github](https://github.com).

Of course, all comments you leave are also publicly visible on the Internet alongside your Github username.

Previously, a comment system called Disqus was used, but all the comments were imported to the new system. If you wish to remove your comment, please contact the studio to delete it.

### If you sign up for the newsletter

When you sign up for the newsletter, information about you, such as your name and email address will be recorded.

You can opt-out from the newsletter at any time.

Your personal information or email address will never be provided to any third parties except where they are specifically employed to help deliver the service, as detailed above.

### Updates to this policy

This privacy policy might get updated from time to time, particularly as technology changes. You can always check this page for the latest version. You may also be notified by email about changes in the privacy policy.

### Any questions?

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your data, please [contact the studio](/contact).
