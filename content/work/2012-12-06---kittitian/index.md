As part of WCRS pitching activities, I was asked to build a responsive HTML5 prototype with a dynamically driven masonry type layout.

<video class="full-img" style="border: 1px solid #CCC; border-radius: 30px;" width="100%" controls>
    <source src="./images/kittitian.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
