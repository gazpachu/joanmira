Privacy matters but it can be confusing. This page explains my approach to privacy on all my websites and how it affects you.

### Short version

* I collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of my pages you viewed.
* I don't use any other tracker or external service
* I don't share the statistics with anyone else

These are just the key points. If you need detail, keep reading.

### Measuring the visitors

I measure visitors to my website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within my site, how you arrived at my site and some basic information about your computer. All of that information is anonymous – so I don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited my site.

The information I collect from analytics helps me understand what parts of my sites are doing well, how people arrive at my site and so on. Like most websites, I use this information to make the website better.

### Discussion comments

To allow visitors to discuss my blog articles and some web pages, I use a discussion system based on Github issues called [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/).

I embed code that Utterances provides and I cannot control it. Nonetheless, in their website they say: No tracking, no ads, always free.

To be able to comment, you need to register an account at [Github](https://github.com).

Of course all comments you leave are also publicly visible on the Internet alongside your Github username, so I do not imagine this is a concern for many people.

Previously I used a comment system called Disqus, but I imported all the comments to the new system. If you wish to remove your comment, please contact me and I will delete it.

### If you sign up for the newsletter

When you sign up for my newsletter, I will record specific personal information about you, such as your name and email address.

You have the ability to opt out of any of this communication at any time.

I will never provide your personal information or email address to any third parties except where they are specifically employed to help deliver my own service, as detailed above.

### Updates to this policy

I may update this privacy policy from time-to-time, particularly as technology changes. You can always check this page for the latest version. I may also notify you of changes to our privacy policy by email.

### Any questions?

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your personal data, please [contact me](/contaact).
