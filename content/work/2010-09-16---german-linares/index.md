During my travels around Asia, I met Germ√°n, a Colombian photographer with a special love for India and Korea. We met in Fukuoka, Japan and we exchanged travel experiences while drinking some Japanese tea. A few months later, I decided to build a Wordpress website for him with a photo gallery for his work.
