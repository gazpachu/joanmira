This project was a collaboration with Narcea Multimedia. I was hired to develop a Flash interface driven by a MySQL database to display information about the thermal villas in Spain. I worked with a graphic designer from Narcea to complete the project. This project was also related to the [Ministry of Industry](http://www.minetur.gob.es/) in Spain and [FEMP](http://www.femp.es/).

The web app included an advanced search feature to allow the users to find the right thermal vila. It also included downloadable Google Earth and GPS coordinates, an image gallery and other data related to the villas which were stored in XML format.
