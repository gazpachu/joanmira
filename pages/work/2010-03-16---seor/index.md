While working at Webmarket, [SEOR](http://www.seor.es/) (Sociedad Española de Oncología Radioterápica) contacted me to request for a custom interactive application development and a video recording service of a few their convections in Navarra, Spain.

The application consisted of a Flash video player with categories and synchronized powerpoint presentations. The slides would automatically change based on the video's current position.
