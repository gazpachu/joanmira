Yesterday I wrote an e-mail to Tae Matsuki (our contact in Sendai). She was the person designated by Sendai City Hall to guide us during our visit, showing us various places of interest and taking us to lunch and dinner on several occasions. Both she and the members of the Miyagi Hispanic Society were extremely kind to Vicente and me and I am glad they are all well. Below I copy the emails we are sending each other:

Hi Tae,

I hope you are all well. I am so sorry to hear about the earthquake disaster and I am very sorry for you. I imagine you are all overwhelmed with the situation right now. Please let me know if I can do anything to help.

A big hug and lots of encouragement!

Greetings to the friends of the Hispanic association in Sendai.

Hi Joan:

Thank you very much for your kind message. Thank God, I and my family members are fine. Although some rooms in the house were damaged, having enough space to sleep and do daily things, we don't need to take shelter. At my house, on Saturday night, the electricity service was resumed.

Regarding the water supply, from the beginning no problem. The only thing missing is gas. They say it will take a few weeks for the resumption of gas service... Well, I am patient and lucky, because, in other areas of the city, water and electricity are still cut off. I believe that here, downtown, the damage was minimal. So the members of the Miyagi Hispanic Society who received you at dinner will be fine because they also live downtown.

However, in other neighborhoods of the city, hundreds of people are said to have been killed by the tsunami. The problem is that, for the time being, even rescue forces such as the Ground Self-Defense Force cannot get close to these places, due to the pile of rubble and lots of muddy water. For this reason, it will take a long time to know exactly the outcome of this catastrophe.

When the situation calms down, I will tell you more details.

Once again thank you for your kind solidarity, best regards.

Tae

Hi Tae!

I am very glad to hear from you. Everyone is following very closely everything that is happening in Japan and the truth is that your words reassure me a little. I hope you can get back to normal as soon as possible and that the damage is as little as possible.

[This article by Héctor](http://www.facebook.com/notes/h%C3%A9ctor-garc%C3%ADa-puigcerver/as%C3%AD-lo-viv%C3%AD-yo-el-mayor-terremoto-de-la-historia-de-jap%C3%B3n-parte-1/10150116984462662), (an alicantino who has been living in Tokyo for several years) I liked it very much. It is a little story of love during the earthquake, narrated in first person. Narrated in first person, it's very touching! I hope you like it.

Please Tae, send me when you can more information about how the situation evolves and some photos (if you can). If you know of any bank account number or way we can show solidarity with those affected, I'm sure some of the followers of La Ruta Samurai will be interested to know.

Best regards and lots of encouragement,
