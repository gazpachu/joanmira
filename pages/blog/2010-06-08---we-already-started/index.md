We have been on the road for four days, but until now we have not had time to update the page. The days have passed quite frantically, we have already done more than 2.000Km!

Many thanks to all the friends and followers of the project, the people of Coria, the city council of Coria, the Spanish-Japanese association of Coria, our sponsors and the media that have been interested in this project. We are very happy and with a lot of strength to move forward.
