I built an audio player using the [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) library, [QT](https://www.qt.io/) and C++.

It supports WAV, MP3, OGG, XM, S3M and other audio formats. I also created an oscilloscope visualisation, an spectrum analyser, time line, volume control, balance, loading files from a URL and a playlist feature.
