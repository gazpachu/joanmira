As part of my involvement in the [iWeekend event](http://iweekend.org/en), I helped to build the selected project: Yo No Cocino, an aggregator of restaurants and other food related businesses with an online ordering process and a delivery system.

I helped to build the blog using Wordpress and a custom theme.
