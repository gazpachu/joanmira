**Pros:**

* You can dress comfortably and as you like. I like pajamas with a robe
* You can save money on transportation
* If you like to cook, you can enjoy your food without having to reheat it
* You can watch the news at your leisure
* You don't get cold or wet on rainy days
* You can eat and smoke whenever you want
* You can listen to music or watch TV while you work
* If you live in a big city, you can avoid the traffic
(assuming you are your own boss)
* Flexible hours. You don't have someone controlling your schedule. If you prefer to work at night (as in my case), you work at night and that's it
* You can use the operating systems and programs you want
* Your work does not have to pass the filter of your boss, to see if the client likes it

**Cons:**

* There may come a time when you do not distinguish home life from work life.
* You can become a big [procrastinator](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrastinaci%C3%B3n)
* Being cooped up all day in your own home
* You have no social life during working hours since you are not in an office with other colleagues (some may like this, I don't have much of a problem with this point) (*solution 1*)
* You can become accustomed to a sedentary lifestyle and spend too much time sitting. Which can lead to obesity or eating disorders (*solution 2*)
(In case you work alone, as a freelancer)
* You don't have a fixed salary per month, you have to get used to saving in case one month you don't have much work.
* In the beginning, if you don't have some clients, it can be difficult to earn money (*solution 3*)

**Solutions to the cons:**

1. Call a friend/colleague to go out to lunch together
2. Join a gym or play sports regularly
3. Partner up with someone to get more job opportunities

And well, those are the ones I can think of, if anyone can think of any others, feel free to send a comment.
