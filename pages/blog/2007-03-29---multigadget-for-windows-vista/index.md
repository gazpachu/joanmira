I present the "Multigadget", a free application for the Windows Vista sidebar that aims to gather small applications of great utility such as a domain search engine with information about the registrant (whois) and a calculator.

My goal is to update this gadget weekly with new features so that we can have as many applications in as little space as possible. If you have any suggestions or requests for the next multigadget updates, you can send them to me by email.

For its correct operation, it is necessary to have installed the Flash 8 plugin (it would be strange if you still don't have it installed...).

You can download it from [Windows Live Gallery](http://gallery.live.com/LiveItemDetail.aspx?li=9f0a2d36-a67e-497d-b11e-16a8f396b0f5)
